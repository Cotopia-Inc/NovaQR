## Usage Instructions

### Generating a QR Code
1. **Enter the Content**:
   - In the "URL / Text" input field, type the URL, text, or any information you want to encode into the QR code.

   - Choose the desired file format from the dropdown menu before saving.

### Customizing Your QR Code
1. **Redundancy Level**: 
   - Select the desired error correction level from the dropdown menu (L, M, Q, H). Higher redundancy levels allow the QR code to be scanned even when partially damaged.

2. **Module Type**: 
   - Choose the type of modules for your QR code (square, dot, or rounded) to suit your design preferences.

3. **Colors**: 
   - Use the color picker to customize the primary color of the QR code and the background color. You can also enter HEX values for precise color selection.

4. **Logo Integration**:
   - To add a logo, click the "Choose" button next to the logo section and upload an image file. The logo will be centered in the generated QR code.

5. **Real-Time Preview**: 
   - As you make changes, the QR code will update in real-time, allowing you to see how your customizations affect the overall design.

## Advanced Features
- **Dynamic QR Codes**: Create QR codes that can be updated with new links or information without changing the QR code itself.
- **Password Protection**: Set a password for your QR code, ensuring only authorized individuals can access the information.
- **Expiration Dates**: Configure QR codes to expire after a certain date.
- **Analytics and Tracking**: Enable tracking features to gather data on QR code scans, including location and device type.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: 
  - The core functionality of NovaQR is contained in `main.js` and `matrix.js`. You can modify these files to add features or adjust existing functionality.

- **Adding Your Logo**: 
  - To change the logo displayed in the application, replace the logo image source in the header section of `index.html` with the URL of your desired logo.

## Troubleshooting
